# P R O S E R U N N E R

Fast prose linter. Finds writing issues, lets you ignore what you don't care about.

## Example

```bash
$ proserunner --file document.md
```

```
document.md
[1]  3:13   "quick as lightning" -> A tired phrase.
[2]  7:15   "software program" -> Pleonastic phrase.
[3]  11:49  "hopefully" -> Skunked term: consider rephrasing.
[4]  13:8   "Female booksalesman" -> Sexist or ridiculous term.
```

Fix what matters, ignore the rest by number:

```bash
$ proserunner --file document.md --ignore-issues 2,3
```

```
document.md
[1]  3:13   "quick as lightning" -> A tired phrase.
[4]  13:8   "Female booksalesman" -> Sexist or ridiculous term.
```

## Quick start

```bash
proserunner --file document.md    # Check a file
proserunner --init-project         # Set up project config
```

## Why it's useful

- **Numbered issues** - Ignore specific problems by number: `--ignore-issues 1,3,5`. Numbers stay consistent.
- **Customizable** - Add checks as EDN files. Toggle them on/off without touching code.
- **Fast** - Parallel processing, smart caching.
- **Flexible** - Output formats: table, JSON, EDN, verbose.
- **Smart ignores** - Run it, fix what matters, ignore the rest by number. Ignores remember location.
- **Team friendly** - Commit ignore files. Everyone sees the same issue numbers.
